# minecraft-dx-optimizer
A simple DLL made with C++ that boosts your frames in Minecraft for Windows 10. This may not work well if you already have a low-end device!

## To use:
- Get a DLL injector
- Open Minecraft and wait for it to exit the red screen and start loading.
- Immediately inject. Tada!

We also provided an FPS Counter in the top left, for you to see the results for yourself.
